Jumbo Mayo was impossible to miss, literally and figuratively. From his earliest days, his extraordinary size set him apart—towering head and shoulders above his classmates, he moved through city streets as a gentle giant, holding doors, reaching high shelves, and carrying burdens without breaking a sweat. Rather than shy away from his stature, Jumbo embraced it, lending his strength in unexpected ways and becoming a local legend for both his height and heart. As he grew, so did his appetite for adventure (and sandwiches), leading him into the world of investigative journalism where his imposing presence opened doors—sometimes quite literally. Known for squeezing into unlikely situations (and occasionally getting stuck), Jumbo has a knack for getting to stories other reporters can't, whether lifting heavy obstacles at disaster sites or acting as both shield and inspiration in the midst of chaos. In every byline, his size is matched only by his courage, reminding everyone that there's a big story behind every big frame.
